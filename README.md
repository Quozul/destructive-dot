# Destructive dot
Destructive dot is a game created by Quôzul in lua using [Löve 2D](https://love2d.org) as a game engine. All sounds from the game were generated with [LMMS](https://lmms.io).

## How to install?
You'll need Löve 2D 0.10.2 on your Android device wich can be found on the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.love2d.android) or you can download the [APK](https://bitbucket.org/rude/love/downloads/love-0.10.2-android.apk) file.  

Download the .love file and put it on your device and open it with a file explorer (e.g. X-plore, open file as */*, select LÖVE for Android).

### Goal
The goal of the game is to destruct the maximum of blocks without getting out of range. The speed of the ball is calculated according to the distance between the selected block and itself.

### Where the settings are saved?
Depending on your operating system, go to the directory listed on [this page](https://love2d.org/wiki/love.filesystem), then find the folder with the name of the game.  
In the config folder you can almost configure everythings: size of the window, border of the game, player radius and blocks size as well as the reach of the player!
